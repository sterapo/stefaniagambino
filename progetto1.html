      <h2>Neve Cosmetics</h2>
      <p class="project-year">2023</p>
      <p class="project-description">The UX/UI redesign project of <b>Nevecosmetics</b> e-commerce was my final project during the design master's program. Throughout the project, I went through all the stages of the design process, starting from discovery to user testing.</p>
      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <p class="project-details">After conducting a heuristic analysis of the website using Nielsen's framework, both on desktop and mobile versions, and assessing its accessibility and usability, I identified some significant issues.
      In particular, the website <b>layout appears confusing and not fully aligned with the brand's values</b>, making it difficult for users to understand the company's offerings. Furthermore, some information is hard to find, and the content hierarchy is not always clear, resulting in a non-intuitive and non-user-friendly website navigation.</p>
      <h3>The goal</h3>
      <p class="project-details">I have simplified and redesigned the site design and redefined the purchase process to make it more fluid and intuitive. Additionally, through benchmarking research and user interviews, I discovered useful services to add to the e-commerce site, such as the ability to search for local stores, a virtual mirror, and the option to place an order without logging in.</p>

      <h3>The process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Graphic identity design: creation of the logo and color palette, study of color accessibility, icon design, and typography selection</li>
        <li>Heuristic analysis, benchmarking, and SWOT analysis</li>
        <li>User research conducted through surveys, drafting of personas, and definition of user journey and user flow</li>
        <li>Definition of Wireframes, Design system and Prototype using Figma software, both for the Mobile and Desktop versions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="project-details">In this case, an unmoderated test was conducted via the UsabilityHub platform on eight target users. The test included a 5-second test and a SUS questionnaire to evaluate the effectiveness of the new interface and overall usability of the e-commerce site. The prototype received a very high satisfaction score in both tests, but additional opportunities for improvement were also identified.</p>
