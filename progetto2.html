      <h2>Cascina Rossana</h2>
      <p class="project-year">2023</p>
      <p class="project-description">This app was designed during a <b>design sprint</b> course organized by FDA. In just five days, we analyzed the problem, created solutions, and tested prototypes.</p>
      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <p class="project-details">Our client Beppe recently joined his family's agricultural business. During the lockdown, he experimented with home deliveries using WhatsApp for orders and Instagram to showcase his work and products. Beppe wants to create an application that can increase and simplify the online sale of fruits and vegetables, however, many of his customers still prefer to physically visit the market.</p>
      <h3>The goal</h3>
      <p class="project-details">As UX/UI designers, our challenge is to design an application that provides an optimal user experience for online fruit and vegetable sales, <b>recreating the journey of the customer</b> physically present at the market.<br>
      <br>
      <b>In collaboration with</b>: Marco Griffini</p>
      <img src="Images/progetto2/photointro.jpg" alt="Vegetable illustration, orange, leek, onion, carrot and egg">
      <h3>The process</h3>
      <p class="project-details">As a first step we have studied the <b>target</b> of customers who routinely frequent the Beppe' stand. Through an interview, we investigated the <b>habits and behaviors of customers</b> in the various stages of purchase : before going to the market, during and after. Finally, we analyzed and clustered the responses in subcategories and created two different profiles of User Personas: <b>the Esporatore and the Abitudinario</b>.</p>
      <img src="Images/progetto2/photopersonas2.jpg" alt="Personas's profiles">
      <p class="project-details">Once we searched for the best solutions using HWM and Brainwriting techniques, we evaluated their priority using the Impact/Effort matrix.The ideas we have evaluated as the most valid are:
      <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 20px">Adding a dedicated <b>section for short videos</b>featuring Beppe: This initiative would allow customers to see the products sold by the company in action and appreciate their features more effectively</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top:0" >Adding a <b>suggested recipe</b> from Beppe for each product for sale: This idea could significantly improve the customer's shopping experience and their loyalty to the company</li>
      <li style="margin-top:0">Adding the possibility to <b>purchase products by weight or by piece</b>: This option would allow customers to choose the exact quantity of product they want to buy, just like at the market</li> </ul></p>
      <p class="project-details">Finally, we created high-fidelity wireframes,designed the logo, selected the color palette, and built the prototype, that we <b>tested with real users</b> in a remotely moderated mode.</p>
