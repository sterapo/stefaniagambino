      <h2>Flipped Out Class</h2>
      <p class="project-year">2023</p>
      <p class="project-description">This landing page is the outcome of three days of collaborative work at the first edition of Sprintaly, an event focused on co-creation and idea sharing to tackle social challenges through innovative design methodologies.</p>
      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <p class="project-details">The issue under examination is that of school dropout, which, according to data from the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research, hovers around 15% in Italy. Students who drop out of school are less likely to find well-paid jobs and realize their potential. Moreover, it can have a negative impact on society as a whole, as it can contribute to social inequality, exclusion, and marginalization.</p>

       <h3>The goal</h3>
       <p class="project-details">My team has identified various factors that contribute to school dropout, such as learning difficulties, low motivation, and ineffective teaching methodologies. In response, we developed a solution called <b>Flipped Out Class</b>, a support service for schools that want to integrate the flipped classroom method.</p>
     </div>
     </div>
      <p class="project-details">This method can help motivate students by offering them a more engaging learning experience and greater autonomy in their studies. It also allows for personalized learning based on each student's strengths and weaknesses. This approach improves the quality of learning by promoting interaction between students and teachers, which facilitates a deeper understanding of the subject matter.</p>

      <p class="project-details">Flipped Out Class will work closely with school leaders to identify their specific needs and create customized training programs for teachers, will provide teachers with the necessary tools and resources to implement the flipped classroom method, including digital content creation software, online learning platforms, and interactive learning materials.
      Moreover, it will offer digital resources for students to use at home, such as videos, podcasts, and interactive quizzes. </p>

      <h3>The process</h3>
      <p class="project-details">As a designer, I led my team through the stages of the design sprint, where we produced ideas and solutions using techniques such as HWM, Sketching, CrazyEight, and Storyboard. Once we established our goals and selected the best idea, we created profiles for our 3 user personas.
      Subsequently, I designed the structure of a landing page aimed at meeting the needs of principals, teachers, and students who want to discover and use the flipped classroom method. The most complex phase was quickly defining a wireframe, studying the path and content to ensure a pleasant and intuitive navigation experience for all users.
      Finally, I created the logo, defined the color palette, and designed the necessary illustrations to create a functioning prototype to test.</p>

    </div>
      <h3>The User Testing</h3>
      <p class="project-details">In the final phase, we recruited students to conduct a moderated <b>usability test</b> in person. We were satisfied with the result, and the design received a <b>positive evaluation</b>. Based on the feedback we received, we made some changes to the microcopy and structure to further improve the user experience.
      Subsequently, we had the opportunity to present our idea to a group of investors <b>who expressed interest </b>in our proposal.</p>
